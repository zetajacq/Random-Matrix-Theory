# Random-Matrix-Theory
This repository contains the code for a coursework in the Statistical Methods in Finance course at Imperial College. The project is about analyzing and replicating the experiment made in the paper Bouchaud, J. P., & Potters, M. (2009). Financial applications of random matrix theory: a short review. arXiv preprint arXiv:0910.1205. More specifically, implementation of the eigenvalue clipping method to clean covariance matrix for portfolio optimization (minimum-variance).
